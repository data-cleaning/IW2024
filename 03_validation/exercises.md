### Exercise 1

What is the $U\tau uX$ $s$ingle/$m$ulti classification of the following rule?

$$
\textrm{mean}(price) \geq 1  
$$

### Exercise 2

What is the $U\tau uX$ $s$ingle/$m$ulti classification of the following rule?

$$
\frac{\textrm{mean}(price_{2018})}{\textrm{mean}(price_{2017})} \leq 1.1  
$$

### Exercise 3

What is the $U\tau uX$ $s$ingle/$m$ulti classification of the following rule?

$$
\max\left(
\frac{x}{\textrm{median}(X)},\frac{\textrm{median}(X)}{x}
\right) < 10
$$

### Exercise 4

What is the $U\tau uX$ $s$ingle/$m$ulti classification of the following rule?

$$
\underbrace{COE + GOS + GMI + T_{P\&M} - S_{P\&M}}_{\textrm{GDP, Income approach}} = 
\underbrace{C + G + I + (X - M)}_{\textrm{GDP, expenditure approach}}
$$


- $COE$: Compensation of employees
- $GOS$: Gross operating surplus
- $GMI$: Gross mixed income
- $T_{P\&M}-S_{P\&M}$: Taxes minus subsidies on production and import
- $C$: Consumption by households
- $G$: Government consumption & investment
- $I$: Gross private domestic investment
- $X-M$: Export minus Imports of goods and services
