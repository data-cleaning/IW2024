### Exercise 1: price sensibility

$$

### Exercise 2: Bounds on inflation

What is the $U\tau uX$ $s$ingle/$m$ulti classification of the following rule?

### Exercise 3: Hiridhogou-Berthelot outlier detection

What is the $U\tau uX$ $s$ingle/$m$ulti classification of the following rule?

\right) < 10
$$

### Exercise 4: Fundamental Equation of National Accounts

What is the $U\tau uX$ $s$ingle/$m$ulti classification of the following rule?

Income must equal expenditure:

$$
COE + GOS + GMI + T_{PM} - S_{PM} =  C + G + I + (X - M)
$$


- $COE$: Compensation of employees
- $GOS$: Gross operating surplus
- $GMI$: Gross mixed income
- $T_{PM}-S_{PM}$: Taxes minus subsidies on production and import
- $C$: Consumption by households
- $G$: Government consumption & investment
- $I$: Gross private domestic investment
- $X-M$: Export minus Imports of goods and services
