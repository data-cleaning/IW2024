All exercises are done in groups. It is important to discuss possible options
amongst each other.


### Exercise 1

1. Read Paul Krugman's Column on the [Excel Depression](https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/19/opinion/krugman-the-excel-depression.html).
2. Google 'Excel Disasters' and find a case where spreadsheets caused a problem in
   (scientific) data analyses. Each group reports one such case.
   

### Exercise 2

Explain where in the statistical value chain the following activities take place. Sometimes
multiple options are possible. Discuss each case within your group. It is important
to explain the reason behind your choice.

1. Formatting a date-time variable to ISO8601 format.
2. Estimate the covariance between unemployment rate and age.
3. Join survey data with a survey reference frame, using unique identifiers
   (such as social security number) so all elements in the survey data can be
   identified.
4. Join administrative data with a reference frame, using approximate record linkage,
   based on approximate matches in name-addres data.
5. Clean up a text variable that contains values such as `"M"`, `"Man"`,
   `"Fem"`, and `"woman"` and replace them with valid codes from a code
   list, like `"male"`, `"female"`, `"other/non-binary"`.
