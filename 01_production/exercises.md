1. Formatting a date-time variable to ISO8601 format.
2. Estimate the covariance between unemployment rate and age.
3. Join survey data with a survey reference frame, using unique identifiers

   based on approximate matches in name-addres data.
5. Clean up a text variable that contains values such as `"M"`, `"Man"`,
