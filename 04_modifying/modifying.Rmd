## Rule-based data modification

$\;$

### Why?

- Up to 50% of all fixed data cells, are made by domain experts on ad-hoc basis.
- Often these fixes are done manually, or hard-coded into script

### Approach

Externalize the data modification rules so they can be 

- Documented
- Maintained (version control)
- Discussed, reviewed
- Programmed over (CRUD)



## Data modification with `dcmodify`


### Concept

Domain experts 'think' in rules of the form

```
IF ( CONDITION ) THEN
  SET X to x
  SET Y to y
  .
  .
END IF
```


## Example in `dcmodify`

```{r}
data(SBS2000, package='validate')
library(dcmodify)

m <- modifier(
    if (is.na(other.rev)) other.rev <- 0
  , if (staff.costs / staff > 5000) staff.costs <- staff.costs/1000
)

out <- modify(SBS2000, m)
```

### Some `dcmodify` facilities

- Read rules from files (`.file="rulefile.R"`)
- Nested conditions
- Add a logger to track data changes rule-by-rule
