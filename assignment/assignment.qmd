title: "Create a Data Cleaning System"
format: pdf

### Task

During this assignment you are going to build a small system that cleans data and produces statistics
automatically.

Each group will have its own synthetic data set. 

The data set contains financial and economic data on companies. We are
interested in publishing the average turnover from industrial activities,
turnover from trade, and operating result, by 3-digit NACE code (the first three
digits of the NACE variable). You can use e.g. `dplyr::summarise` to compute the
results.

You will build a set of scripts that cleans the raw data and estimates the desired quantities.

In the afternoon each group will share its results by presenting their system.
This may be a Powerpoint presentation but you can also just show the scripts and
talk through it. 


### Tips

- Look at the data. Make plots, discuss amongst each other what can be wrong with it, and how it might
  be solved. Don't try to solve everything at once. Solve one problem at the time.
- Start by doing the estimates. They will be way off, but it is good to have a first result and see
the effect of updates to the data cleaning process.
- It is better to have simple code that runs than complicated code that doesn't. Start small, make sure it runs and then
expand.
- Use one script for each step in the statistical value chain. Each script reads an input, does something to the data, and writes an output.
- Define rules to check the quality of the data. Also here: work iteratively. Start with a few rules
  and adapt the ruleset iteratively.
- Iterate often, view the data and the results often.
- Make plots of the data: are there outliers? Also think about ratios between variables.
- Impute the missing values. Try a few models.



### The data


The financial variabeles have to satisfy the following balance restrictions. You can think of extra 
restrictions as you deem fit.
